It is a uniaxial accelerometer that assesses accelerations ranging from 0.05-2.0 G and is band limited with a
frequency response from 0.25-2.5 Hz.

The acceleration signal is filtered by an analog bandpass filter and digitized by an 8 bit A/D converter at a sampling
rate of 10 samples per second.

Each digitized signal is summed over a user specified time interval (epoch), and at the end of each epoch the activity
count is stored internally and the accumulator is reset to zero. In the current study, a 60-s epoch was used and
activity counts were expressed as the average counts per minute over the 6 min of exercise.
